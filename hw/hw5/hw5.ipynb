    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset. In this assignment we'll try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
