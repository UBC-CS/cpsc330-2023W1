    "    - what do you want to accomplish?\n",
    "    - whether you really need to use machine learning for the problem or not\n",
    "    - how do you want to frame the problem as a supervised machine learning problem? What do you want to predict? \n",
    "    - how do you plan to measure your success? \n",
    "    - is there a baseline? \n",
    "    - is there any operating point? \n",

    "#### Initial analysis, EDA, preprocessing\n",
    "1. Random train-test split with fixed random seed; do not touch the test data until Step 16.\n",
    "2. Exploratory data analysis, outlier detection.\n",
    "3. Choose a scoring metric -> higher values should make you & your stakeholders happier.\n",
    "4. Feature engineering --> Create new features which might be useful to solve the prediction problem. This is typically a time-consuming process. Also, sometimes you get an idea of good features only after looking at your model results. So it's an iterative process. \n",
    "5. Fit a baseline model, e.g. `DummyClassifier` or `DummyRegressor`.\n",

    "#### Model building \n",
    "1. Try a linear model, e.g. `LogisticRegression` for classification or `Ridge`; tune hyperparameters with CV.\n",
    "2. Try other sensible model(s), e.g. LightGBM; tune hyperparameters with CV.\n",
    "3. For each model, look at sub-scores from the folds of cross-validation to get a sense of \"error bars\" on the scores.\n",
    "4. Pick a few reasonable models. Best CV score is a reasonable metric, though you may choose to favour simpler models.\n",
    "5. Carry out hyperparameter optimization for these models, paying attention to whether you are not susceptible to optimization bias. \n",
    "6. Try averaging and stacking to examine whether you improve the results over  your best-performing models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model transparency and interpretation \n",
    "1. Look at feature importances.\n",
    "2. (optional) Perform some more diagnostics like confusion matrix for classification, or \"predicted vs. true\" scatterplots for regression.\n",
    "3. (optional) Try to calibrate the uncertainty/confidence outputted by your model.\n",
    "4. Test set evaluation.\n",
    "5. Model transparency. Take a random sample from the test data and try to explain your predictions using SHAP plots. \n",
    "6. Question everything again: validity of results, bias/fairness of trained model, etc.\n",
    "7. Concisely summarize your results and discuss them with stakeholders.\n",
    "8. (optional) Retrain on all your data.\n",
    "9. Deployment & integration.\n",
