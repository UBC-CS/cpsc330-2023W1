## Deliverable due dates (tentative)
Usually the homework assignments will be due on Mondays (except next week) and will be released on Tuesdays. We'll also add the due dates in the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html). If you find inconsistencies in due dates, follow the due date in the Calendar. For this course, we'll assume that the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html) is always right!

## Lecture schedule (tentative)

**Live lectures**: The lectures will be in-person. The location can be found in [the Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html). The lectures will be recorded and will be made available after 5 pm on lecture days. You can find the link of Panopto videos in Canvas. That said, consider the recordings a backup resource and do not completely rely on it. You will get a lot more out of the course if you show up in person. 

This course will be run in a semi flipped classroom format. There will be pre-watch videos for many lectures, at least in the first half of the course. All the videos are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHofvQE1VlGtZoAULxcHb7lOsMved0CuM) and are posted in the schedule below. Try to watch the assigned videos before the corresponding lecture. During the lecture, we'll summarize the important points from the videos and focus on demos, iClickers, worksheets, and Q&A. 

We'll be developing lecture notes directly in this repository. So if you check them before the lecture, they might be in a draft form. Once they are finalized, they will be posted in the [Course Jupyter book]().

### [Covid Safety at UBC](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/ubc-campus-rules-guidance-documents/#COVID-19%20Campus%20Rules)

Please read [Covid Campus Rules](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/ubc-campus-rules-guidance-documents/#COVID-19%20Campus%20Rules).  

**Masks:** This class is going to be in person. UBC no longer requires students, faculty and staff to wear non-medical masks, but continues to recommend that masks be worn in indoor public spaces.  

**Your personal health:**
If you are ill or believe you have COVID-19 symptoms or been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 use the [Thrive Health](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) self-assessment tool for guidance, or download the [BC COVID-19 Support App](https://welcome.thrive.health/bc-covid19-app) for iOS or Android device and follow the instructions provided. Follow the advice from [Public Health](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions).

Stay home if you have recently tested positive for COVID-19 or are required to quarantine. You can check [this website](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who) to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor. 
 
Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed: 
- All course notes will be provided online. 
- All homework assignments can be done and handed in online. 
- All exams will be held online. (But you need to be present in the classroom to write the exam unless there is a legitimate reason for not doing so.)  
- Most of the class activity will be video recorded and will be made available to you. 
- There will be at least a few office hours which will be held online.


## Land Acknowledgement

UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) peple. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.

It is important that this recognition of Musqueam territory and our relationship with the Musqueam people does not appear as just a formality. Take a moment to appreciate the meaning behind the words we use:

**TRADITIONAL** recognizes lands traditionally used and/or occupied by the Musqueam people or other First Nations in other parts of the country.

**ANCESTRAL** recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.

**UNCEDED** refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.

As you begin your journey at UBC, take some time to learn about the history of this land and to honour its original inhabitants.
